## Introduction to Workspaces & Projects
#### Why separate predefined projects from the WorkFlow?
 
## Managing Projects & Tasks

Each project area is separated into 3 sections: **Backlog** (To-do), **In Progress** (Active) and **Completed** (Done). In essence, we follow the [Kanban workflow][2] which emphasizes on just-in-time delivery while not overloading the team members.

#### Backlog (To-do)
#### In Progress (Active)
#### Done

## Tags
#### Estimate
#### Investigate
#### Dev
#### On Hold
These are tickets that require input or resolution from a third party, i.e the client
#### Pending
Pending means that the assigned agent has a follow-up question for the requester i.e the client
#### Test
This task requires testing. Testing prior to 'go live' wil happen on either the Stage or CTL (close to live) site(s).
