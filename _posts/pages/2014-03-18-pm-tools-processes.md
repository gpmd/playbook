##Introduction to Workspaces & Projects
At GPMD, each client has its own Workspace, and each Workspace contains one or more project(s). By default, each client has a project called **WorkFlow** which is the main area used to log tasks such as bugs, new features, estimates and any other kind of support work which requires our help. 

In order to differentiate ongoing and day-to-day support work from predefined projects, we tend to separate the two by creating project specific working areas within the Workspaces.

The diagram below shows the separation between a predefined project (Release 2.1.0) and the WrokFlow for one of our our clients called Winterson.

####Why separate predefined projects from the WorkFlow?
 
##Managing Projects & Tasks

Each project area is separated into 3 sections: **To Do** (Backlog), **In Progress** (Active) and **Completed** (Done). In essence, we follow the [Kanban workflow][2] which emphasizes on just-in-time delivery while not overloading the team members.

####To Do (Blacklog)
Tickets in the To Do section are **inactive** and are **unassigned**. 
####In Progress (Active)
####Done

##Tags
####Estimate
To avoid discrepancies between the estimate and the actual time it will take to complete a task, it's important that both the estimation and the actual work is carried out by the same developer. Most estimates are none billable, but longer estimates can be billable.
####Investigate
This task requires investigation. Unless stated otherwise, these tasks are none billable.
####Dev
This task is being actioned / implemented by a 'developer'. This is a good visual way for us to differentiate development work from everything else!
####On Hold
These are tickets that require input or resolution from a third party, i.e the client
####Pending
Pending means that the assigned agent has a follow-up question for the requester i.e the client
####Test
This task requires testing. Testing prior to 'go live' wil happen on either the Stage or CTL (close to live) site(s).
