## Support

We use Zendesk to manage support tickets, [submit a ticket here](http://support.gpmd.net)

Tickets are reviewed when submitted with items either added to each clients backlog, or schdulled into a release straight away, depending on the urgency of the item

## On Going Work

All work arranged into Releases no matter how small.  A release can consist of one or more items. Our preferred method of working is to group work together, because there is an overhead for pushing each release live and testing it is more efficient to have serval items in a release.

Releases are agreed in advance, with the investment agreed in advance, we follw these simple rules for each release:

- Each release agreed and time allocation signed off
- Once planning has started no items can be added to the release

### The Release Process

#### Pre Planning
- Client confirms work is required, either by phone, email or support
- Items to be included in the release are agreed in advance (a release can contain one or more items)
- During Pre-planning a risk and effort estimation are assigned to each item
- Items are marked as Must Have or Nice to Have
- Must have items should account for no more than half the available time for the sprint
- A project for the Release is created harvest
- Release notes are drafted
- Email the details to the client and cc Office Manager

#### Planning
- Meeting with Project Managers, Developers, Designers and the client to agree the details for each item in the release
- The stories are refined
- Development tasks outlined
- Design/UX work undertaken (this may require several rounds of feedback)

#### Development

- Mid way demo
- Client available to answer any questions that may crop up
- Demo to the client and the team to demo work completed

#### Launch
