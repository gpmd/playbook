## Support

We use Zendesk to manage support tickets, [submit a ticket here](http://support.gpmd.net)

Tickets are reviewed when submitted with items either added to each clients backlog, or schdulled into a release straight away, depending on the urgency of the item

## On Going Work

All work arranged into Releases no matter how small.  A release can consist of one or more items. Our preferred method of working is to group work together, because there is an overhead for pushing each release live and testing it.  So it is more efficient to have serval items in a release.

Releases are agreed in advance, along with the investment required and the business objectives.

We follow these simple rules for each release:

- Make sure we understand the business benefit of the work we are doing 
- Each release is agreed in advance
- Once planning has started no items can be added to the release
