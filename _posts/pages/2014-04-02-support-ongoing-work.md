## A New Post

All work arranged into Releases no matter how small.

- each release agreed and sign off
- once planning has started no items can be added to the release
- once complete invoice is created and sent

Process for each release:

- client confirms work is required, either by phone, email or support
- work is either added to the backlog
or a release is scheduled and agreed
- a release can contain one or more items

When a release is scheduled:
- create a project in harvest
- add the details of what is included to the release notes
- email the details to the client and cc becki

When the release goes live
- email the details to the client and cc becki
- Becki sends invoice to the client
