Below are some suggestions for maintaining a consistent writing style on the Playbook.

## Spelling

British English spelling is preferred. There are many online dictionaries you could use for reference, the [Collins English Dictionary](http://www.collinsdictionary.com/ "Collins English Dictionary") being one of them.

However, when writing code (particularly CSS), use American English spellings.

```css
.link--primary-color { color: blue; }
```

## Titles

All titles should be written in title case. For example **"This is the New GPMD Playbook"**. The first letter of the first and last word should always be capitalised.

Titles of newspapers, magazines, books etc. should be italicised. For example *The Times* newspaper. Short works, such as articles, songs, poems etc. should have Quotation marks. For example, "A Beginner's Guide to Grunt".

## Punctuation

Use only one space after a full-stop. Two spaces is just wrong - we don't use typewriters any more!

Don't use periods in Acronyms. For example, IKEA (**I**ngvar **K**amprad **E**lmtaryd **A**gunnaryd)

But do use periods in abbreviations. For example, R.S.V.P. (**R**épondez **s**'il **v**ous **p**laît).

## Numbers

Numbers should be spelled out up to 10. For example one, two three etc. Above 10 they should be written as numbers. For example 11, 12, 13 etc. The exception is in page/post titles, where they should not be spelled out.

Percentages should use numerals and spell out the word "percent". For example, 10 percent.
