Below are some suggestions on maintaining a consistent style on the Playbook. Please do see them as guidelines though â€“ everyone's writing style is their own. Enjoy!

## Spelling

British English spelling is preferred. There are many online dictionaries you could use for reference, the [Collins English Dictionary](http://www.collinsdictionary.com/ "Collins English Dictionary") being one of them.

Numbers should be spelled out up to 10. For example one, two three etc. Above 10 they should be written as numbers. For example 11, 12, 13 etc. The exception is in page/post titles, where they should not be spelled out.

Percentages should use numerals and spell out the word "percent". For example, 10 percent.

## Titles

All titles should be written in title case. For example **"This is the New GPMD Playbook"**.
