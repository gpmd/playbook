<p class="lead">At GPMD we use a Git branching model based on something called Gitflow. Full details can be found on <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" title="Gitflow">Vincent Driessen's website</a>.</p>

One of the best things about Git is the ability to create ‘branches’. A branch is basically a whole new snapshot of your codebase at a point in time. We create branches so we can code new features and functionality, and then merge these changes back into the master branch at a later stage.

At the core of our project are two branches, ‘master’ and ‘develop’. All development work is done on the ‘develop’ branch. While working on a project we create additional ‘feature’ branches off of ‘develop’. Once our ‘develop’ branch is at a stage where we want to publish our site we create a ‘release’ branch off of ‘develop’. Work can then continue on the ‘develop’ branch with new features. The new ‘release’ branch is then merged into the ‘master’ branch, and then 'master' is merged back into the 'develop' branch. And so it goes on in an endless loop.

It might sound a bit complicated, but once you start using it you’ll find you quickly get to grips with it.

## 1. Feature Branches

Create a new feature branch off of `develop`.

```bash
$ git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

When you've finished working on your feature you can commit your changes and then merge it back into `develop`.

```bash
$ git checkout develop
$ git merge --no-ff feature/my-new-feature
$ git push origin develop
```

---

## 2. Release Branches

Release branches branch off of `develop` as well.

```bash
$ git checkout -b release/0.2.0
```

The next step is optional, but it's common practice to include a `.version` file in the root directory of your project. Once you've created your new release branch increase the version number in that file and commit it - this provides a 'point-in-time' record of when the version number was changed.

```bash
$ git commit -a -m "Bumped to version 0.2.0"
```

When you've made your release branch you merge it into master.

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git merge --no-ff release/0.2.0
$ git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Version 0.2.0"
$ git push --tags origin master
```

**IMPORTANT:** When you've done that you should merge `master` back into `develop`.

```bash
$ git checkout develop
$ git merge --no-ff master
$ git push origin develop
```

You can now remove the release branch.

```bash
$ git branch -d release/0.2.0
```

## 3. Hotfix Branches

Hotfix branches branch off of the `master` branch. They are used when bugs and issues need fixing, but `develop` is not in a stable enough state to be released.

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git checkout -b hotfix/my-hotfix-0.2.1
```

Bump the version number in `.version` and commit the change.

```bash
$ git commit -a -m "Bumped to version 0.2.1"
```

Fix the bug/issue and commit the changes.

```bash
$ git commit -m "Fixed bug"
```

Once you've done that you need to merge the hotfix back into `master`.

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git merge --no-ff hotfix/my-hotfix-0.2.1
$ git tag -a v0.2.1 -m "Version 0.2.1"
$ git push --tags origin master
```

**IMPORTANT:** Now merge `master` back into `develop` so it also contains the fix.

```bash
$ git checkout develop
$ git merge --no-ff master
$ git push origin develop
```

Finally, you can remove the hotfix branch.

```bash
$ git branch -d hotfix/my-hotfix-0.2.1
```
