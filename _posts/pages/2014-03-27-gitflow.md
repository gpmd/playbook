At GPMD we use a Git branching model called Gitflow. Full details can be found on [Vincent Driessen's website](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

One of the best things about Git is the ability to create ‘branches’. A branch is basically a whole new snapshot of your codebase at a point in time. We create branches so we can code new features and functionality, and then merge these changes back into the master branch at a later stage.

In order to manage this process effectively we use something called ‘Gitflow’. To fully describe Gitflow is beyond the scope of this report, but here is a quick summary.

At the core of our project are two branches, ‘master’ and ‘develop’. All development is done off of the ‘develop’ branch. While working on a project we create additional ‘feature’ branches off of ‘develop’. Once our ‘develop’ branch is at a stage where we want to publish our site we create a ‘release’ branch off of ‘develop’. Work can then continue on the ‘develop’ branch with new features. The new ‘release’ branch is then merged into the ‘master’ branch. And so it goes on in an endless loop. It might sound a bit complicated, but once you start using it you’ll find you quickly get to grips with it.
