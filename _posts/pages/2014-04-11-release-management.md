GPMD run our release process as follows:

#### Pre Planning
- Client confirms work is required, either by phone, email or support
- **Business objectives** for the work should be discussed, along with how this will be measured
- Items to be included in the release are agreed in advance (a release can contain one or more items)
- During Pre-planning a risk and effort estimation are assigned to each item
- Items are marked as **Must Have** or **Nice to Have**
- Must have items should account for **no more** than half the available time for the sprint
- A project for the Release is created in Harvest ([our time tracking tool](/tools/)
