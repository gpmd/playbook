* Our Playbook was inspired by the brilliant [Thoughtbot Playbook](http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/) - *we hope you guys don't mind this form of flattery*?
* It was designed and build by [@_mattbailey](http://www.twitter.com/_mattbailey) on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).
* The font is [Brandon Grotesque](https://typekit.com/fonts/brandon-grotesque) from Typekit.
* The site was lovingly created using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home), and a number of glasses of [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) for good measure.
