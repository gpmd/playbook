The Playbook is a flat file site built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

## Signing up and logging in

1. In order to edit the site please ask one of the administrators to add you to the Github team. If you don't have a Github account you can [sign up for a free one here](https://github.com/join).
2. Once you have a Github account and an administrator has added you to the team visit [prose.io](http://prose.io/) and click "Authorise On Github".
3. In the right sidebar click on the group called "GPMD" and you should see the "Playbook" project in the main column. Click on "View Project".

## Project structure

4. Prose is set up to allow you to edit the "Table Of Contents" and pages. All other files are hidden from view.
5. "Table of Contents" can be found in `_includes/table-of-contents.md`.
6. Pages are found in `_posts/pages/`.
7. You can also edit `index.md` (the TOC is automatically pulled in below the content).
