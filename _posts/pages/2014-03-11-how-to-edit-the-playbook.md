The Playbook is a flat file site built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

## Signing up and logging in

1. In order to edit the site please ask one of the administrators to add you to the Github team. If you don't have a Github account you can [sign up for a free one here](https://github.com/join).
2. Once you have a Github account and an administrator has added you to the team visit [prose.io](http://prose.io/) and click "Authorise On Github".
3. In the right sidebar click on the group called "GPMD" and you should see the "Playbook" project in the main column. Click on "View Project".

## Project structure

1. Prose is set up to allow you to edit pages and the "Table Of Contents". All other files are hidden from view.
2. Pages are found in `_posts/pages/`.
3. "Table of Contents" can be found in `_includes/table-of-contents.md`.
4. You can also edit `index.md` (FYI, the TOC is automatically pulled in below the content).

## Markdown

1. All content is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).
2. For a demonstration of what you can do with Markdown [click here](http://playbook.gpmd.io/markdown-demo/).
3. For a reference of Markdown syntax [click here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

## Editing Pages

1. Simply browse to the `_posts/pages/` directory and open one of the pages to edit the contents.
2. Content should be written in Markdown - you can use the simple Prose toolbar if you need some help (see below).
3. You can also use regular HTML in Markdown documents if you want to do something more complicated (see the [Markdown Demo](http://playbook.gpmd.io/markdown-demo/) for examples).
